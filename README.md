# wp-plc-skeleton

## Introduction

This is a skeleton wordpress plugin for oneplace skeleton based modules.

This plugin is based on a boilerplate that was accepted to be published on 
wordpress.org - so if you don't mess up with the code too hard, it should 
get approved on wordpress.org if you want to make it publicly available in wordpress.

## Installation

Activate plugin

have fun

**WP PLC Connect needs to be activated and connected for this plugin to work**

## Integrations

Work the way you want! WP PLC Skeleton Widgets come with optional full Elementor
integration. If you don't have / like / want Elementor, you can also use classic shortcodes
and soon also gutenberg blocks for the same widgets ! 

Everything is loaded only if you activate it, to make the plugin as lightweight as possible.
