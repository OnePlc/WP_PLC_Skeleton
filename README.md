# wp-plc-skeleton

## Introduction

This is a skeleton wordpress plugin for oneplace skeleton based modules.

This plugin is based on a boilerplate that was accepted to be published on 
wordpress.org - so if you don't mess up with the code too hard, it should 
get approved on wordpress.org if you want to make it publicly available in wordpress.

## Installation

Activate plugin

**[WP PLC Connect](https://github.com/OnePlc/WP_PLC_Connect) needs to be activated and connected for this plugin to work**

## Widgets

There are plenty of widgets and templates shipped with WP PLC Skeleton for you 
to use if you like. All of them are optional and only loaded once activated.

### Skeleton Slider

A nice looking, fully customizable Slider based on [swiperjs](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper)

It is configured the work with the onePlace Skeleton API `list` function - so as long as you return
at least the same data (you can return more), you should be able to use the widget without any code changes
for your own, skeleton based, modules.

## Integrations

Work the way you want! WP PLC Skeleton Widgets come with optional full Elementor
integration. If you don't have / like / want Elementor, you can also use classic shortcodes
and soon also gutenberg blocks for the same widgets ! 

Everything is loaded only if you activate it, to make the plugin as lightweight as possible.
